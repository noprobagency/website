# AGENT.md

## Project Context

- Project: `noprob.agency`
- Stack target: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, App Router
- Priority: replicate the current `https://noprob.agency` homepage as faithfully as possible while setting up strong SEO and tracking foundations
- Current session goal: rebuild the homepage from the extracted Framer HTML/CSS so the live result matches noprob.agency as closely as possible, using the exact light theme, typography, spacing, and asset mapping while keeping `pnpm tsc --noEmit` and `pnpm build` passing

## Working Rules

- Do not invent metrics or brand claims. Reuse copy and figures from the live site.
- Default to Server Components. Use client components only when interaction requires them.
- Avoid inline styles whenever a Tailwind or CSS-variable solution is practical.
- Keep the visual language consistent with the live site:
  - light theme
  - `#f0f0f0` page background with white and off-white cards
  - black primary actions and black footer/pricing section
  - green Trustpilot/status accents
  - Source Serif 4 italic for emphasis and section personality
  - Inter / Inter Display typographic hierarchy from the Framer export
- Increment `siteConfig.version` in `lib/site.ts` on every content or code change so the footer always exposes the latest shipped version.
- End each completed change with `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm build`, a clear conventional-style git commit, and `git push`.
- Do not commit `.env.local`
- Update this file as work is completed

## Decisions

- A local `pnpm` shim was added because `pnpm` was not installed in PATH on this machine. It forwards to `corepack pnpm`.
- The initial `create-next-app@latest` scaffold produced a Next 16 + Tailwind 4 template. The project is being realigned to Next 15 and Tailwind 3 to match the requested config shape.
- The project is now pinned to Next.js `15.5.14`, which is the current maintained Next 15 backport line published on the npm registry.
- Live copy and structure are being taken from the published `https://noprob.agency` homepage and not from invented placeholder content.
- The exact “PARTE 2” source for this file was not included in the prompt, so this document is a working equivalent synthesized from the task brief.
- The homepage now uses locally downloaded assets from `public/images`, including renamed hero partner logos for Shopify, WooCommerce, Google Partner, Meta Business Partner, and Klaviyo Partners.
- The earlier dark-theme draft was intentionally replaced with a light system based on the live site’s warm off-white backgrounds and dark text.
- Footer versioning is now sourced from `siteConfig.version` in `lib/site.ts`; future edits must bump that value before shipping.
- GA4 and Meta are wired behind GDPR consent via `vanilla-cookieconsent`; IDs remain environment-driven through `.env.example`.
- The current homepage refactor is aligned to Framer-export tokens and structure: `#f0f0f0` page background, black pricing/footer blocks, Inter-led typography, and Source Serif 4 italic emphasis.
- The homepage footer is not rendered in `app/layout.tsx`; it remains part of the homepage composition to match the live landing structure.
- The latest polish pass focuses on screenshot fidelity: hero headline breaks, integrated chart/quote card, partner logo scale, and results-carousel badge placement.
- The hero chart now uses the imported original SVG asset `public/images/originals/hero-profit-chart.svg` instead of a hand-drawn approximation.

## Notes

- The Sanity CLI syntax has changed from the one in the brief, so a local Sanity scaffold was created manually with `sanity.config.ts`, `sanity.cli.ts`, and an empty schema entrypoint to keep the codebase ready without blocking the homepage sprint.
- Visual reference for this redesign was taken from the live `https://noprob.agency` homepage plus the Framer-extracted CSS/HTML values provided in the brief.
