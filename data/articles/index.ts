          'No. Shopify has a three-day free trial and a promotional three-month period at $1 per month for new merchants. The lowest-cost plan after that is $29 per month. There is no permanent free plan.',

        question: 'Does Shopify work for small businesses?',
        answer:
          'Yes. Shopify was designed for small to medium B2C businesses and remains the most used platform in that segment globally. The Basic plan at $29/month is genuinely sufficient for early-stage stores. Most small businesses find the admin interface significantly more manageable than alternatives like WooCommerce.',

For the vast majority of B2C brands, standard plans are more than sufficient.',

For advanced design customization, non-standard integrations, or performance optimization, technical skills or a specialized partner are needed.',

        question: 'How does Shopify compare to WooCommerce for fashion brands?',
        answer:
          'For fashion brands specifically, Shopify has meaningful advantages: better out-of-the-box mobile experience, more reliable uptime, cleaner integration with Meta and Google advertising, and easier setup for multi-channel selling. WooCommerce can match most functionality with the right plugins and developer resources, but the maintenance overhead is consistently higher.',

Per la grande maggioranza dei brand B2C italiani, i piani standard sono più che sufficienti.",

        question: "If I stick to the same strategy, won't I fall behind while competitors innovate?",
        answer: 'No, because keeping the strategy does not mean changing nothing. It means keeping the foundations stable (platform, core team, processes) and iterating on top continuously. Competitors who change everything every quarter are burning energy, not building competitive advantage.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How long before I see results with a long-term approach?',
        answer: "The first measurable improvements arrive in 3-6 months on tactical KPIs like conversion rate, AOV, and retention. Structural results on total revenue require 12-18 months. It's slower than viral tricks, but it compounds: each month that passes the advantage grows, it does not reset.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I tell if I'm paying a hidden cost from constant changes in my eCommerce?",
        answer: "Make this list: in the last 12 months, how many times did you change core team members, platform, ad strategy, tracking setup, agency? If you changed more than 2 things, you're paying a cost you probably don't see on the P&L but that exists. SHRM estimates the loss of institutional knowledge represents 60-70% of the real turnover cost.",
      },
      {
        question: 'Does a long-term eCommerce strategy cost more than a short-term one?',
        answer: 'In the short term it seems to cost the same. In the long term it costs much less. Continuous changes generate recurring costs of onboarding, ramp-up, and knowledge loss that you never see aggregated on the balance sheet. Keeping a stable team costs less and produces better results, both in KPIs and in revenue predictability.',
