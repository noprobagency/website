        question: "If I stick to the same strategy, won't I fall behind while competitors innovate?",
        answer: 'No, because keeping the strategy does not mean changing nothing. It means keeping the foundations stable (platform, core team, processes) and iterating on top continuously. Competitors who change everything every quarter are burning energy, not building competitive advantage.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How long before I see results with a long-term approach?',
        answer: "The first measurable improvements arrive in 3-6 months on tactical KPIs like conversion rate, AOV, and retention. Structural results on total revenue require 12-18 months. It's slower than viral tricks, but it compounds: each month that passes the advantage grows, it does not reset.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I tell if I'm paying a hidden cost from constant changes in my eCommerce?",
        answer: "Make this list: in the last 12 months, how many times did you change core team members, platform, ad strategy, tracking setup, agency? If you changed more than 2 things, you're paying a cost you probably don't see on the P&L but that exists. SHRM estimates the loss of institutional knowledge represents 60-70% of the real turnover cost.",
      },
      {
        question: 'Does a long-term eCommerce strategy cost more than a short-term one?',
        answer: 'In the short term it seems to cost the same. In the long term it costs much less. Continuous changes generate recurring costs of onboarding, ramp-up, and knowledge loss that you never see aggregated on the balance sheet. Keeping a stable team costs less and produces better results, both in KPIs and in revenue predictability.',
